Batch Production Service Requirements
#####################################

LDM-636
=======

This document describes the requirements relating to the Batch Processing Services.
These services should not be confused with IT-level batch services like PBS, Slurm, and HTCondor.
The LSST Batch Production Services are a layer that sits above the IT-level batch services that executes and manages science payloads as "campaigns" consisting of a defined pipeline, a defined configuration, and defined inputs and outputs.

This document does not cover Operationâ€™s requirements that are outside of the scope of the Batch Production Services, e.g., having change board approval (or pre-approved rules) prior to changing a Production configuration. Where Use Cases are mentioned, they are defined in \citeds{LDM-633} which also includes a glossary.
